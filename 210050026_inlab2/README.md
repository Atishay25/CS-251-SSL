## About this Repository
This is repository is a part of an Inlab Assignment of **SSL course - CS251**. The assignment was about learning *Bash* and Version Control using *Git/Github*.
The **Hash Function** is used for implementing a dictionary type Data Structure which maps its keys to their respective values. A Hash Function maps the input (which may be a string, integer, float or any other data type) to a certain integer which is then used as its key for dictionary. This kind of Hashing gives more secure, adjustable and quicker method of fetching data.
The enhanced Hash function used here is -
$$h(s) = \sum_{i=1}^n s[i-1]p^i$$
And then took final key as h(s) % m.


### Instructions to run code
The Bash script file (test.sh) has all the compilation commands required to run the code.So, you have to just run test.sh script.
Type the following command to compile and run the code -
`./test.sh <arguement>`
Pass the string that you want to give as input in the <arguement>

* Q1 -
    1. alias sizeOfFiles = "du -ah"
    2. alias numberOfFiles = "find . | wc -l"
