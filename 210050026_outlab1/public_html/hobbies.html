                Cricket is one of those sport which I have been watching a lot from my childhood. Cricket is a very popular
                sport in India, Although Hockey is National Sport of India, Cricket is Emotional Sport of India. That's why many people
                do watch cricket and play it, even in gullies. I also played a lot of gully cricket in my childhood. The first time when I 
                started watching cricket was during the first match of 2011 World cup between India and Bangladesh, which was a memorable one
                (India won, ofcourse). Also, talking about IPL, I'm die heart fan of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) right from 2011. 
                I have always supported CSK, and the 2018 season when they make a super comeback and won the IPL was again a dream season for me.

                Badminton is another sport which I like to play and which fascinates me a lot. I used to play it when I was in school
                but then after 10th it almost went away from my life :( Now, I have started playing badminton again whenever I get free time 
                here at insti. Although I do not play well as compared to other players around here, yet I enjoy the game and try to 
                learn from others & improve myself. Now a days, I'm too much interested in watching Badminton games between pro players, I mean 
                the way they play the game with such quick reflexes & energy is just magnificent!

                Music is a very beautiful thing and I enjoy a lot when I play music. I used to play keyboard, finding out to play any
                random song on keyboard that I liked and just playing around with it makes me happy. Especially those classical Indian beats,
                Qawwali type songs, evergreen melodies were really awesome to play!

                Gym is another thing which excites me. I started going to gym after I joined IIT Bombay only. Whenever I get some free time somehow,
                I generally go to play badminton or Gym. Well, Fitness is a very important aspect of everybody's life. And, that's why I try to
                become fit via activities like yoga, gym, sports etc. But, sadly, I'm not that fit currently. I hope i'll try better!

                As I said, Music is a very beautiful thing. Listening to music keeps you relaxed and cool. It sometimes can even change whole mood 
                od a person. I enjoy listening to music, especially my favourite ones. Listening to music cherishes your soul. It can take you 
                back into your memories, no matter good memories or bad. Even today, when I listen to something that I heared in my chidhood, that 
                melody reminds me of my childhood and that's why I always have a special place to those old songs in my heart. It is like a flashback ride,
                I can really associate some events of my life with the songs that I used to listen around them. Talking about my interests, I like Indian songs more than
                English ones, specially the desi qawallis, old evergreen melodies, indian classical and joyful songs.

              Yes, I'm a Rail Fan. I like to travel in trains a lot and just see status of running trains, where are they,
              which train goes where, how many haults, which loco shed supplies it the loco etc etc and talk about these stuffs. Those powerful locomotives with lots of coaches and people,
              taking them around the country are just amazing. The vibe of railways fascinates me, It's just awesome how such a large network of trains work (although I know
              someimes trains become extremely late :( and I myself have suffered from it). The beauty of the locomotive engines is just magnificent, and among those
              the mighty White Beast - "WAP 7" is my favourite one, which is derived from a goods loco WAG 9. Its similar model with more acceleration but less horse power - WAP 5
              is also one of my favourites. Ah! there are many many locos, coaches, and train types that work and all are my favourite.

            Marvel Comics! I like them very much and I am biggest die heart fan of Tony Stark (IRONMAN). I remember that my connection
            to marvel got established first time when I used to watch an Ironman cartoon that used to come when I was at 4th standard. That 
            cartoon was awesome man, it included a completely young Tony! Sadly, I've never seen that cartoon again. But, soon I got to know
            about movies (real human ones) that are on Ironman and then on Captain and then on Thor, Avengers, Spiderman, Doctor Strange etc and
            all of them been linked with each other. The MCU films at that time were so much interesting and amazing!
